# Welcome, IMAGE Contributor!

An overall description of IMAGE can be found at [IMAGE Project Public Website](https://image.a11y.mcgill.ca).
This page is for those joining the project as contributors.

McGill team members: Please keep in mind that the IMAGE code repos are public, so make sure to author content and comments appropriately, and do not include any internal links or resources, including passwords or account information.

## Project Board

The center point for working on IMAGE is our [IMAGE Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/Shared-Reality-Lab/projects/2), where we track all our work items and issues across multiple repositories. Guidelines:

* Make issues specific and measurable so it is easy to determine whether it is complete (e.g., "work on x" can linger forever)
* Never move an issue left in the project board without discussing with your lead and adding an @jeffbl comment
* Scope issues to no more than 3 person-days of work OR add more granular checklist in description
* We essentially use the [Github flow tutorial](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) model for development, more detail in the [Github docs on pull requests/branching](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches).

## Development Resources

* SRL repos beginning with IMAGE-* are project repos. Each should be described on its homepage. Public ones are:
  * Server components: https://github.com/Shared-Reality-Lab/IMAGE-server
  * Browser extension: https://github.com/Shared-Reality-Lab/IMAGE-browser
  * Graphics used for testing and associated test scripts: https://github.com/Shared-Reality-Lab/IMAGE-test-graphics
* Wiki pages (default in the server repo, if not repo-specific) cover things like the test/production servers, docker usage, etc.

## McGill Internal Development

If you're on the McGill development team, we have some additional internal resources you'll need to sign up for. Ask @jeffbl for info.

* For general SRL tools, e.g., group calendar, lab policies, etc., see the [SRL internal wiki](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/srlwiki/). Note that you will need to use the McGill VPN to get in.
* We use Slack for quick communication, meeting reminders, etc. but please don't use it as a substitute for github issues.
* In the Slack #general channel, there are pinned messages pointing to:
  * Google Drive, containing internal documentation related to funding, user studies, etc. Some documents you may want to scan when you first join:
    * StatementOfWork: what we've promised to funders
    * Open Source Audit: Spreadsheet of open source components we use. Must be kept up-to-date, since this creates licensing and acknowledgement obligations.
    * Orgchart: An overview of how everyone fits together on the project
  * Times and online links to weekly meetings
* Zotero library of relevant papers and articles

## UX resources
Anything user testing and/or participant-related such as testing procedures, consent forms, and REBs is STRICTLY controlled as per McGill confidentiality practices. Some resources such may be found in the UX repo or be found in the UX repo wiki. For anything else, contact @Cybernide for access.
